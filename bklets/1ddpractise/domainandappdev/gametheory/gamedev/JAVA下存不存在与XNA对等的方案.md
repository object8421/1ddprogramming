So I¡¯ve heard of libraries like swing. Is there some kind of framework like XNA though?

there is essential differences between swing for java and XNA for .net in sense of gamedev.

you see,in java enterprise dev areas(the webdev areas),there are J2EE frameworks,j2ee coporated with jvm,plus w3c standards (the browser techs), taking ¡°webapp dev,deployment,design¡± all into one(all these were conclude to form the fully developt middleware ¨C the ¡°webapp mod engine¡°,users,progers,designers,then all work under this engine to mod apps with least possible effort on ever-solved things to workout their final problem specified apps),in a sentence, this drive webapp and webdev into webapp model and webapp dev areas.where ¡°deploy=dev,dev=design¡±¡£

the final webapps thus can be just made up some final target-problem-domain logics (the java web engine mod apps classes,docs with the help of the integrated appmodel engine) as said above.

but java never has a appmodel for gamedev historically in which progers can use to define their app under a framework and app player just like j2ee and browser for game,not to mention w3c standards,or appcontainer standards like jboss as j2ee standards implents.

in swing,progers can only treate swing as the game lib like when they are in traditional cpp game graphic programming days,the swing editors,however,just as the mapeditor,the outputs are some artworks,with no scripts for the final game,not general to be as the framework template for common gameapps or mapmods,gamemods.even all these were satisfied,there is still much other things to be needed compared with java webdev.

However,in .net XNA. All things for ¡°a game appmodel engine and gameapp dev¡±are fully support yet with a addon IDE support(this does the same work like j2ee,jboss for webdev as the dev framework ¨C not the app container),Special editon .net clr envirment were offered to form a ¡°game .netfx¡± app container£¬and xna classes were added to the .netfx classes to offer gamedev domain dev supports,the xna editors,produces not the artwork but the c# scripts(the concrete game mod),that is to say,if there is a game appmodel,there is a game app.and xna satisfy this.¡ªso xna is a real-sense a gamemod engine system.

¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª¡ª

So,java swing and xna works differently towarding gamedev and in a different height towarding gamedev. While the first scheme just replace the cpp with java,while the latter develop a full-feature game appmodel enginesets for gamedev.
