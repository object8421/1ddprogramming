Ok so school started and i will be taking programming lessons. This is programming video games. I just wanted to ask what languages you can use to program in unreal, unity and cryengine?

in unity3d , is the .netfx c# or mono plays the role of underlay scripting or programming.

in fact ,unity3d itself is not a engine,ide,lib,compent or platform in any of these above traditional meanings. it is a ¡°game mod system¡± which stands for ¡°game appmodel¡±.

so the right learning way for programming or game programming (also is the answer for you question) is to make yourself understood that

1.between language and games,which will you learn at? (language is general,game programming could be limited in a sharp small corner area)

2,which language will you learn?(cpp,c#,or just a gamemaster like thing with bit scriptings needed?)

3,which type of ¡°game apps¡± will you dev with the language?(native graphic based ones,or vm framework based ones?or unity3d intergrated appmodel based ones?)
