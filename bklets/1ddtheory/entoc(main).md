part i : the theory parts
mission target:just grasp the overall views of computer arts and programming arts

---
month 1 - the basis of computer arts and programming arts
--
what is programming: how the industy and enger begins from zero
--
pc and real mode machine
--
Turing math model and von Neumann architecture
interpter system and execute routine in machine lvl
the original form of programming: instructions were more on used on controling the machine and for basic science calc tasks
--
the birth of software system
--
the protect mode added to the cpu
software task system
software io system
software execute routine
windows vs linux
--
the advanced subsystem of os
--
the graphic system and the desktop envirment
the inter-connect system and the networking system
--
highlvl language C:the language for softwares compared to the way assembly language for the hardware lvl pc.
--
adv language system and the compiler theory
adv language system and the runtime backend supports to the hosting os
static typed language system
language type system
langugae runtime lvl execute routine system
C's primitive type system
procedure memeory manage model
language paradism:the procedural paradism
C libs and C binaray compent techs
--
the 1st type of programming: when programming indutry focus mainly on the basic software system implentment - the domains,the schemes
--
the datastructs and algos 
--
the essences of algos - discrete math model of problem solving in software way.
function complexity degree
various ds and algos patterns
special algos for the concrete problem
--
system programming is a domain for os appdev using C and based on os
--
low lvl system implentments (this is the advance form of first type of programming)
low lvl native appdev (such as memerymanager model in hiberarchy appstacks,io logics..)
--
system programming limits
--
C is not not enough highlevel for many appdev domains and its sytax are too simple to hold more express needs for more appdomains.

--

month 2 : the industy advance the programming infrastructure to the highlvl ones more on the programmer's view
--
vm runtime language systems : vm is software language system in the sense of "os is a software machine system to the pc"
--
what is abtract and integrate
--
software is adding lvls of abstractness and bringing more integrate degress
design is arts(for everything including programming)
--
abstract and integrated language system
--
dynamic type language system
vm-integrated language system
better c runtime
adt,udt runtime memeory model
soft VM
dotnetclr
--
abstract language sytax techs
--
abstract code system and type system : the udt,adt uniform datatype and codetype system.
abstract produres based on udt,adt
abstract produres-control-flow based on udt,adt
cpp udt system
cpp template system
--
asbract language paradism (commonly oo based)
--
dynamic scripting
functional way
generic programming
metaprogramming programming
mutiple paradism mixed
-- 
the 2st tyep of programming and appmodels
--
highlvl designs for highlvl app models and problem domains.
--
more oo ways (advanced oo techs:interface based,compent based,aspect based)
oo design patterns
more domains schedma (xml,regex,etc..)
more domains languages (scripting,meta)
more developing paradism (visual drag-drop,dymic compent based,data-driver)
more tools and assistant ways(uml,debug)
agile engineering ways (xp..)
-- 
appmodels
--
vm desktop apps based on vm languages.
web programming and enterprise based on vm languages
mobile programming based on vm languages.
----

part ii:the practise part (taking c# for example)

----

mission target: master a vm language system and finish a practial project dev,practise more,the better,practise deeper,the better
--
language foundations
--
C# implanted Designing Types as .net foundation
--
Type and Member Basics
Constants and Fields
Methods: Constructors, Operators, Conversions, and Parameters
Properties
Events
--
C# implanted Essential Types as .net foundation classes
--
Chars, Strings, and Text
Enumerated Types and Bit Flags
Arrays
Interfaces
Delegates
Generics
Custom Attributes
Nullable Value Types
--
c# nativedevs apis
--
c# yourdomains related apis (reuse the 3rd party libs or implentment one)
--
App building:the engine and engine plugins (the engine mods)
--
based on you prj
--
App building :the engine editor and other products
--
based on you prj
